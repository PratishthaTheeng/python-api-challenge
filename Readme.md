# PYTHON API CHALLENGE
Module 6 Challenge is to figure out the weather based on their geography. This module demonstrates the use of Python, APIs, and data analysis to answer the question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" Using weather.py, we gathered weather data across various cities and latitudes using the OpenWeatherMap API. We then analyzed trends such as temperature increase near the equator.

The vacation.py script takes this a step further—using the collected weather data to identify ideal vacation spots based on user preferences (like temperature, humidity, and cloud coverage). This project highlights how real-world data and Python skills can power informed decision-making—like choosing the perfect vacation destination.
